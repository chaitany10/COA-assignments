-Implemented 32 bit register using 32 D flipflop that were used in previous question(added a reset).

-A for loop is generated for each one of the 32 bit and each input is fed to dflip flop when reset is 0.

-When reset is equal to 1,the register is cleared by storing 0 in each of the 32 flipflops.
