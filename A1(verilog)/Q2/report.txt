Decoder
Implemented using NAND gates.
For example D[0] is low only if all inputs(a,b,c,d) are low.
Enable determines whether decoder is active or not.
Encoder
In this question according to truth table of the encoder outputs are assigned the desired value.
e.g. output a[3] is 1 if d[8] or d[9] or d[10] or d[11] or d[12] or d[13] or d[14] or d[15] is 1.
Meaning if any one of these inputs are 1 output a[3] will be one. So or gates are used to get desired output.
Again Enable is used to show when the circuit is active and when not.
